## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
# turn off sci notation
options(scipen=999)
#load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(refinr)

```

```{r}
read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")

Question 3: Of 50 of the nationâ€™s largest cities, Baltimore is one of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis.


Data for 2014-

```{r} 
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2014
homicide_2014 <- homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2014")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

homicide_2014

```


```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2014 that were closed by arrest
homicide_arrest_2014 <- homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Closed by arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2014")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

homicide_arrest_2014
```



math:
```{r}
#Here we are finding the percent of closed by arrest cases in 2014

(86/211)*100
```
86 arrests in 2014 out of 211 homicides, 40.75% no arrest

Data for 2017-

```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2017
homicide_2017 <- homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2017")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

homicide_2017

```


```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2017 that were closed by arrest
homicide_arrest_2017 <- homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Closed by arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2017")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

homicide_arrest_2017
```



math:
```{r}
#Here we are finding the percent of arrests in 2017

(93/340)*100
```

93 arrests in 2017 out of 340 homicides, 27.35% arrest

Answer: We can confirm that Baltimore makes less arrests in 2017 than in 2014.
