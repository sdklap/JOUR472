## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}

Question 3: Of 50 of the nationâ€™s largest cities, Baltimore is one of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis.


Data for 2014-

```{r} 
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2014
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2014")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```

```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2014 that were open and had no arrest
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Open/No arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2014")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```


```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2014 that were closed and had no arrest
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Closed without arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2014")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```


math:
```{r}
#Here we are finding the percent of no arrests in both closed and open cases in 2014
13+112

(125/211)*100
```
125 non arrests in 2014 out of 211 homicides, 59.24% no arrest

Data for 2017-

```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2017
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2017")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```


```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2017 that were open and had no arrest
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Open/No arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2017")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```

```{r}
#Here we are calculating the number of homicides in Baltimore in 2017 that were closed and had no arrest
homicide_data |> 
  filter(str_detect(disposition, "Closed without arrest")) |> 
  filter(str_detect(reported_date, "2017")) |> 
  group_by(city) |> 
  summarize(count_city = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(count_city))

```

math:
```{r}
#Here we are finding the percent of no arrests in both closed and open cases in 2017
11+236

(247/340)*100
```

247 non arrests in 2017 out of 340 homicides, 72.65% no arrest

Answer: We can confirm that Baltimore makes less arrests in 2017 than in 2014.
