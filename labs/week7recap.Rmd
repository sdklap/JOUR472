## Loading the packages

Run the codeblock below to load the packages we will need for this recap

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)
```

## Load Data

Run the codeblock below to load the data.

```{r}
earthquakes <- read_csv('https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_month.csv')

#Setting time column as datetime
earthquakes <- earthquakes |> mutate(time = as_datetime(time))
```

#### Answer the questions below

Most questions have a code block and a space for an answer below. Write the code you think is necessary and, in the answer space, write out what you did and what was the result.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q1** Look at the earthquakes dataset. Finish the sentence below as if you were explaining the data to someone who had not seen it before but needs to know about it.

**A1:** This dataset contains information about earthquakes including date, location, and severity 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q2** How many records there are there in this dataset? What do they mean and what useful information we can gather from it, looking at the columns?

**A2:** There are 9774 observations of 22 variables 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q3** How do I reorganize this data to see the ones that are the deepest first? What is the depth that shows up for the deepest one, and its magnitude?

```{r}
 earthquakes |>
  arrange(desc(depth))
```

**A3:** The earthquake with the greatest depth happened on September 27, 2023 at the Vanuata region, and it was 4.2 mag at 669.9820	depth. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q4** I just want to see the earthquakes with a magnitude larger than 6. How do I do that? And how many are there that fit this criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6)|>
  arrange(desc(mag))
```

**A4:**
There are 13 earthquakes larger than a 6 magnitude
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q5** What about if I want to see earthquakes that have both a magnitude larger than 6 and a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [both]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6)|>
  filter(depth < 20)|>
  arrange(desc(mag))
```

**A5:** There are 6 earthquakes that fit this criteria.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q6** What about if I want to see earthquakes that either have a magnitude larger than 6 OR a depth smaller than 20? How many are there in the data set that fit [either]{.underline} these criteria?

```{r}
earthquakes |>
  filter(mag > 6|depth < 20)|>
  arrange(desc(mag))
```

**A6:**
There are 7,445 earthquakes that fit this criteria
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q7** I'm interested in finding earthquakes that took place in Alaska. Which column should I look at? How do I use it to find all the earthquakes in Alaska? How many earthquakes took place there?

```{r}
earthquakes |> 
  filter(str_detect(place, "Alaska")) 
```

**A7:**
There were 3,443 earthquakes in Alaska 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q8** I notice that there is a column called 'type', that seems to have different kinds of tremors. What is the best way to find what are all the possible types of tremors, and counting how many of each there are in this data set? What are the first two most common types of tremors in this data set?

```{r}
  earthquakes |> 
  group_by(type) |>
    summarize(count_type = n()) |> 
    arrange(desc(type))
```

**A8:** There are five types: quarry blast, other, ice quake, explosion, and earthquake. The most common, by far, is are regular earthquake at 9527. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q9** What is the average depth of the earthquake type in this data set? Is there anything that seems unusual or surprising in this finding?

```{r}
  earthquakes |> 
   filter(str_detect(type, "earthquake")) |> 
  summarise(mean_value = mean(depth)) 
```

**A9:** The depth average is 25.2313	 

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q10** I'm interested, in the future, to see the hours in which earthquakes happen. How can I extract the hour from the time column?

```{r}
hour <- earthquakes |> 
mutate(hour = hour(time))
```

**A10:**
Uses the "hour" function from lubridate
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q11** I want to make a note of all the records in this data set that I consider serious. For my purposes, I'm thinking that all tremors that have a magnitude that is larger than 3 are serious. How do I automatically create a new column showing whether an earthquake is serious or not?

```{r}
serious <- hour |> 
   mutate(serious = case_when( 
     mag > 3 ~ "serious", 
          .default = "not serious"))
```

**A11:**
You would mutate and use case when.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q12** I have no idea how earthquakes work and I'm interested in seeing if there is a particular time of day in which serious earthquakes happen. How can I see that condensed in a table with all the hours in a day and all the serious earthquakes in each hour? What is the hour with fewer serious earthquakes and the one with the most serious earthquakes?

```{r}
serious <- hour |> 
   mutate(serious = case_when( 
     mag > 3 ~ "serious", 
          .default = "not serious"))
        
serious|>
totalbyhour <- count(serious, hour) |> 
  filter(str_detect(serious, "serious")) |>
  group_by(hour)|> 
  summarise(
    count=n()
  )|> 
      arrange(desc(hour))
```

**A12**: The hour with the most serious earthquakes was 14:00 and the hour with the least was 11

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Q13** What's another question you are interested in and how would you ask it in R?

What location has the most earthquakes?


```{r}
earthquakes|>
  group_by(place)|>
  summarise(count_earthquakes = n()) |>
        arrange(desc(count_earthquakes))
```
